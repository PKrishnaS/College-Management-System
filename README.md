## 🔐 Login
The system includes a simple login (login.php) and logout (logout.php) system using PHP sessions.

Only authenticated users can access index.php and other core pages.

## 📌 Concurrency Control
Each student record includes a last_updated timestamp.

During updates, the timestamp is checked to prevent conflicting writes by different users at the same time.
